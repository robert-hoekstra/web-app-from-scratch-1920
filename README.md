# Introduction
"Star Wars - a Galactic web app" is a online tool and product made for educational purposes only. It is a project that is part of the web development minor taken in Amsterdam in 2020. The core of the project is to make a single page web application written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Part of the project is to retrieve an API and use it's data.

The API can be used via the root URL: https://swapi.co/api/

## What is it?
The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe!

We've taken all the rich contextual stuff from the universe and formatted into something easier to consume with software. Then we went and stuck an API on the front so you can access it all!
